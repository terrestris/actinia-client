# Java actinia client library

This library can be used to conveniently access an actinia instance. The implementation caches drastically, so make
sure you use a new client if your GRASS workspace was changed externally.

Have a look at the tests to see how you can perform various tasks.

Please note that the module plugin needs to be installed in the used actinia instance.
